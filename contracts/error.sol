//  Yes, the require function in Solidity does revert state changes if the condition
//  within it is not met. When a require statement fails, all changes to the state 
//  made by the function are reverted, and all gas provided for the transaction is 
//  consumed.
//  This is a safety feature of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to ensure that
//  transactions are atomic, meaning they either fully execute or donâ€™t execute at
//  all. This helps prevent situations where a transaction partially executes, which
//  could lead
//  to inconsistencies in the contractâ€™s state.
//  Additionally, require can provide an error message that will be included in the 
//  transactionâ€™s log, which can be helpful for debugging.
